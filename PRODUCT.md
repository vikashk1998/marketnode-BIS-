# Bond Issuance System — Product Specification

## 1. Overview

The Bond Issuance System (BIS) manages corporate bond issuances from creation through subscription, allocation, coupon payments, and maturity.

**Key flows:**
- Bonds are created via SFTP file upload (batch process).
- Investors browse and subscribe to bonds via the web application.
- After book close, bonds are allocated to subscribers proportionally.
- Coupon payments are generated daily (on business days) for allocated subscribers.
- At maturity, principal is returned to subscribers.

**Authentication:** User authentication is not in scope for this system. The application provides predefined mock users (INV-001 through INV-005) with a user switcher in the UI. API calls identify the acting user via the `X-User-Id` header.

## 2. Business Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Bond** | A debt instrument created via SFTP file upload with defined terms (ISIN, issuer, coupon rate, face value, total size, maturity date, book dates). |
| **Book** | The subscription window for a bond. Has open/close dates tied to business dates. |
| **Subscription** | An investor's order to purchase a specified quantity of a bond. Made via API or UI. |
| **Allocation** | After book close, bonds are allocated to subscribers. Proportional if oversubscribed, full if not. |
| **Coupon Payment** | Daily interest payment to allocated subscribers (on business days only). |
| **Maturity** | Return of principal to subscribers at bond maturity date. |
| **Business Date** | The operational date used for all lifecycle events. Weekends (Sat/Sun) are not business days. |

## 3. Bond Lifecycle States

```
File Upload → PENDING → OPEN → CLOSED → ALLOCATED → MATURED
                                              ↓
                                      Coupon payments
                                      daily (business days)
```

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `PENDING` | Bond created from file upload but book not yet open. |
| `OPEN` | Business date is within book window. Investors can subscribe. |
| `CLOSED` | Book is closed. No new subscriptions accepted. |
| `ALLOCATED` | Subscriptions allocated. Coupon schedule active. |
| `MATURED` | Bond reached maturity date. Principal returned. |
| `CANCELLED` | Bond cancelled before allocation. |

---

## 4. Subscription States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `PENDING` | Subscription received, awaiting book close. |
| `ALLOCATED` | Investor received allocation (full or partial). |
| `REJECTED` | Subscription rejected (oversubscription rules or cancellation). |

---

## 5. Bond Creation via SFTP

Bonds are created by uploading CSV files to the SFTP server.

**Upload path:** `/upload/bonds/BONDS_YYYYMMDD_NNN.csv`

**SFTP connection:**
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `2222`
- Username: `bonduser`
- Password: `bondpass`

**File format:**

```csv
isin,issuerName,bondName,currency,faceValue,couponRate,maturityDate,totalSize,bookOpenDate,bookCloseDate
MYBND2600001,ACME Corp,ACME 2026 Senior Notes,MYR,1000.00,0.0005,2026-06-05,1000000,2026-05-05,2026-05-10
MYBND2600002,Beta Inc,BETA 2026 Notes,MYR,500.00,0.0004,2026-06-08,500000,2026-05-06,2026-05-12
```

**Validation rules:**
- File must include the exact header row.
- `isin` must be non-empty, unique across all bonds. Format: alphanumeric, 12 characters.
- `issuerName` must be non-empty, max 255 characters.
- `bondName` must be non-empty, max 255 characters.
- `currency` must be a valid 3-letter ISO currency code (e.g., `MYR`, `USD`).
- `faceValue` must be positive, at most 2 decimal places. Maximum: 1,000,000.00.
- `couponRate` is a daily rate, must be between 0 and 1 (exclusive), at most 4 decimal places.
- `totalSize` must be a positive integer. Maximum: 100,000,000.
- `bookOpenDate` must be a valid date and must be before `bookCloseDate`.
- `bookCloseDate` must be a valid date.
- `maturityDate` must be a valid date and must be after `bookCloseDate`.
- All dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- Duplicate file names are rejected (not reprocessed).
- Malformed rows produce file-level exceptions (not silently skipped).

---

## 6. Subscription Rules

- Subscriptions are only accepted when the business date is between `bookOpenDate` and `bookCloseDate` (inclusive).
- `quantity` must be a positive integer.
- Available size must be tracked atomically — concurrent subscriptions exceeding remaining capacity must not all succeed.
- Each investor may only subscribe once per bond.
- Subscription requires `X-User-Id` header identifying the investor.

---

## 7. Allocation Rules

After book close:
- If total subscribed ≤ `totalSize`: all subscribers get their full requested quantity.
- If total subscribed > `totalSize` (oversubscribed): proportional allocation.
  - Each subscriber gets: `floor(their_quantity / total_subscribed × totalSize)`
  - Subscribers with allocation = 0 are marked `REJECTED`.

---

## 8. Coupon Payment

- Daily coupon, paid on every business day (Monday–Friday) while the bond is in ALLOCATED status.
- Amount per subscriber per day: `faceValue × couponRate × allocatedQuantity`
- The `couponRate` in this system is a **daily rate** (not annualized).
- Example: faceValue=1000, couponRate=0.0005, allocatedQuantity=100 → daily coupon = **50.00**
- No coupon is paid on weekends (Saturday, Sunday).
- Coupon is paid up to and including the maturity date (if the maturity date is a business day).
- All amounts use exact decimal (no floating-point).

---

## 9. Maturity

- At maturity date, principal is returned to each allocated subscriber.
- Amount: `faceValue × allocatedQuantity`
- Maturity date must be a business day. If it falls on weekend, payment is on next business day.

---

## 9A. Worked Example — Daily Coupon Payments and Maturity

The following end-to-end example illustrates a bond from issuance through daily coupon payments to maturity.

### Setup

Bond uploaded via SFTP:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| isin | MYBND2600099 |
| issuerName | MegaCorp |
| bondName | MEGA 2026 Notes |
| currency | MYR |
| faceValue | 1,000.00 |
| couponRate | 0.0005 (daily) |
| totalSize | 100,000 |
| bookOpenDate | 2026-06-01 |
| bookCloseDate | 2026-06-10 |
| maturityDate | 2026-06-25 |

### Subscriptions (during book window 2026-06-01 to 2026-06-10)

| Investor | Quantity |
|----------|----------|
| INV-001 (Alpha Capital) | 40,000 |
| INV-002 (Beta Fund) | 30,000 |
| INV-003 (Gamma Holdings) | 50,000 |

Total subscribed: 120,000. Bond totalSize: 100,000. **Oversubscribed.**

### Allocation (after book close)

Proportional allocation: each subscriber receives `floor(their_quantity / 120,000 × 100,000)`.

| Investor | Subscribed | Allocated | Status |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| INV-001 | 40,000 | 33,333 | ALLOCATED |
| INV-002 | 30,000 | 25,000 | ALLOCATED |
| INV-003 | 50,000 | 41,666 | ALLOCATED |

Note: total allocated = 99,999 (rounding down means fractional remainder is unallocated).

### Daily Coupon Payments

Daily coupon formula: `faceValue × couponRate × allocatedQuantity`

Once bond is ALLOCATED, coupon is paid each business day until maturity.

**Example — 2026-06-11 (Thursday, first business day after allocation):**

| Investor | Calculation | Daily Payment |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| INV-001 | 1,000 × 0.0005 × 33,333 | **16,666.50** |
| INV-002 | 1,000 × 0.0005 × 25,000 | **12,500.00** |
| INV-003 | 1,000 × 0.0005 × 41,666 | **20,833.00** |

**Weekend skip:** 2026-06-13 (Saturday) and 2026-06-14 (Sunday) — no coupon paid.

**2026-06-15 (Monday):** Same daily amounts as above.

Coupon continues daily until maturity date (2026-06-25).

Total business days from 2026-06-11 to 2026-06-25: 11 days (excluding weekends).

**Total coupon for INV-001:** 16,666.50 × 11 = **183,331.50**

### Maturity (due 2026-06-25 — Thursday, business day)

Maturity formula: `faceValue × allocatedQuantity`

| Investor | Calculation | Principal Returned |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| INV-001 | 1,000 × 33,333 | **33,333,000.00** |
| INV-002 | 1,000 × 25,000 | **25,000,000.00** |
| INV-003 | 1,000 × 41,666 | **41,666,000.00** |

After maturity payment, bond status transitions to `MATURED`.

## 10. Predefined Users

| User ID | Name |
|---------|------|
| `INV-001` | Alpha Capital |
| `INV-002` | Beta Fund |
| `INV-003` | Gamma Holdings |
| `INV-004` | Delta Partners |
| `INV-005` | Epsilon Trust |

The application has a user switcher in the header. API calls use `X-User-Id` header.

## 11. API Overview

The system exposes two API versions simultaneously:

- **API v1** (`/api/v1/...`) — Uses **snake_case** field names and flat response structure.
- **API v2** (`/api/v2/...`) — Uses **camelCase**, nested structures, string amounts, and ISO timestamps.

Both versions provide endpoints for: listing bonds, viewing bond details, subscribing, viewing portfolio (subscriptions, coupons, maturities).

Full API documentation is available via **Swagger UI** at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

Key headers:
- `X-User-Id` — Identifies the acting investor (e.g., `INV-001`). Required for subscription and portfolio endpoints.

---

## 12. Business Date & System Control

- Business date is the operational date driving all lifecycle logic.
- Weekends (Saturday, Sunday) are not business days.
- The system timezone is Asia/Kuala_Lumpur.
- On first startup, business date is initialized to the current calendar date and persisted in the database.
- The system does **not** automatically advance the date. Time progresses only through explicit API calls.

### System Control API

#### `GET /api/system/date`

Returns current business date.

```json
{ "business_date": "2026-05-06" }
```

#### `POST /api/system/advance-date`

Advances business date by **one day** and triggers all lifecycle events for the new date:

1. Bond status transitions (PENDING → OPEN if book open date reached; OPEN → CLOSED if book close date passed)
2. Allocation of newly closed bonds
3. Coupon processing for bonds with payment due
4. Maturity processing for bonds reaching maturity

Response:
```json
{
  "business_date": "2026-05-07",
  "message": "Date advanced. Lifecycle events processed."
}
```

#### `POST /api/system/reset`

Resets business date to today's calendar date. Used for test environment cleanup.

```json
{
  "business_date": "2026-05-06",
  "message": "System reset to today's date"
}
```

## 13. Money Precision

- All monetary values use exact decimal representation.
- `faceValue` has at most 2 decimal places.
- `couponRate` is a daily rate with at most 4 decimal places.
- Coupon and maturity amounts are calculated with exact decimal arithmetic.
- No floating-point arithmetic for financial calculations.
